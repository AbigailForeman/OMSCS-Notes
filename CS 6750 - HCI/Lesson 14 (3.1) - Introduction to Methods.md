# Lesson 14

In this unit we will cover the following topics:

1. User-centered design
2. Four stages of the design life cycle
3. Qualitative vs quantitative data
4. Design life cycle

## User-centered Design

In general we can't design great interfaces just by applying guidelines and heuristics. Instead, we have to interact with our users, understand their needs, and involve them in the evaluation process.

- **User-centered design** - design that considers the needs of the user throughout the entire design process

## Principles Of User-centered Design

There are six principles of user-centered design:

1. The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments
2. Users are involved throughout design and development
3. The design is drive and refined by user-centered evaluation
4. The process is iterative
5. The design addresses the whole user experience
6. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives

## Stakeholders

There are many types of stakeholders who user or are impacted by our interface:

- **Primary** - our user who uses the interface directly
- **Secondary** - are people who don't use our system directly but who might interact with the output of it in some way
- **Tertiary** - are people who never interact with the tool or output but who are nonetheless impacted by the existence of the tool

## The Design Life Cycle

User-centered design is about integrating the user into every phase of the design life cycle. We need to know two things:

1. What the design life cycle is
2. How to integrate the user into each phase

Our model of a design life cycle will cover four phases:

1. **Needfinding** - we gather a comprehensive understanding of the task the users are trying to perform
2. **Design alternatives** - developing very early ideas on the different ways to approach the task
3. **Prototyping** - take the ideas with the most potential and we build them into protoypes that we can then actually put in front of a user
4. **Evaluation** - we take our ideas that we prototyped and put them in front of actual users, here is where we get user feedback

## Methods For The Design Life Cycle

Shown below is the design life cycle with methods in between each phase.

## Qualitative Vs Quantitative Data

**Quantitative data**:

- Observations described or summarized numerically
- Supports formal tests, comparisons, and conclusions
- Is strong for a small class of things

**Qualitative data**:

- Observations described or summarized non-numerically
- Supports any kind of response or observation
- Covers a broader picture of what we're examining
- Is more prone to biases

**Mixed method**: a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data

## Types Of Nominal Data

There are four main types of quantitative data:

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

## Types Of Qualitative Data

There are many types of qualitative data, below are some examples:

1. Transcripts
2. Field notes
3. Artifacts

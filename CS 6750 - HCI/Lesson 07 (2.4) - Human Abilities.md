# Lesson 7

In this lesson we cover the following:

Psychology of what humans can do, we will also cover three systems: input processing, and output.

1. **Input** - how stimuli are sent from the world, and perceived inside the mind
2. **Processing** - cognition, how the brain stores and reasons with over the input it's received
3. **Output** - is how the brain then controls the individual's actions out in the world

## Memory

- **Chunking** - chunking is a grouping together several bits of information into one chunk
- **Perceptual store** - very short term memory lasting less than a second
- **Short-term memory** - memory that is able to hold about four to five chunks at a time
- **Long-term memory** - seemingly unlimited store of memories; it is harder to put things into long-term memory than short-term memory

## Cognition

One of the elements of cognition is _learning_, there are two types:

1. **Procedural learning** - how to do something
2. **Declarative learning** - knowledge about something

When designing user interfaces, cognitive load comes into play as follows:

1. We want to reduce the cognitive load posed by the interface so the user can focus on the task
2. We want to understand the context of what else is going on while users are using our interface

## 5 Tips: Reducing Cognitive Load

1. Use multiple modalities
2. Let the modalities complement each other
3. Give the user control of the pace
4. Emphasize a essential content and minimize clutter
5. Offload tasks

## Conclusion To Human Abilities

Here are some of the main topics covered in this lesson as it relates to human abilities:

- **Perception** - main ways people perceive the world around them through sight, sound, and touch
- **Cognition** - memory and learning
- **Motor system** - how the person interacts with the world around them

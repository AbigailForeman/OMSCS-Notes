# Lesson 5

We cover feedback cycles in this lesson. In addition we will cover:

- **Gulf of execution** - distance between a user's goals and the actions required to realize those goals
- **Gulf of evaluation** - distance between the effects of those actions and the user's understanding of the results

## Gulf Of Execution

There are a number of components in the gulf of execution:

1. Identify intentions
2. Identify actions
3. Execute in interface

How do we go about bridging the gap between user's goals and actual execution?

1. Make functions discoverable
2. Let the user mess around
3. Be consistent with other tools
4. Know your user
5. Feed-forward

## Gulf Of Evaluation

There are a number of components in the gulf of evaluation:

1. Interface output
2. Interpretation
3. Evaluation

How do we go about bridging the gap between the effects of user's actions and actual results?

1. Give feedback constantly
2. Give feedback immediately
3. Match the feedback to the action
4. Vary you feedback
5. Leverage direct manipulation

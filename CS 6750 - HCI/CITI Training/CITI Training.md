Notes from modules in CITI training

## Belmont Report and Its Principles

Three basic ethical principles:

1. Respect for Persons
2. Beneficence
3. Justice

## Students in Research

- **Undue influence** - Whether positive (individuals wish to participate out of belief that it will gain favor with a superior) or negative (individuals fear repercussions from a superior for participating), institutional hierarchies can affect how potential subjects feel about volunteering for a study
- **Convened review** - When research activities pose significantly higher risks to subjects than those that might occur in daily life, the project will need convened review (also commonly referred to as “full committee” or “full board” review) and must receive majority approval from members at the meeting

## History and Ethical Principles

Under the principle of beneficence:

1. Risks to subjects are minimized
2. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result
3. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects
4. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data

## Defining Research with Human Subjects

Defining research: a systematic investigation including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.

Defining human subjects: a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:

1. Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens
2. Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens

Notes from modules in CITI training

## Belmont Report and Its Principles

Three basic ethical principles:

1. Respect for Persons
2. Beneficence
3. Justice

## Students in Research

- **Undue influence** - Whether positive (individuals wish to participate out of belief that it will gain favor with a superior) or negative (individuals fear repercussions from a superior for participating), institutional hierarchies can affect how potential subjects feel about volunteering for a study
- **Convened review** - When research activities pose significantly higher risks to subjects than those that might occur in daily life, the project will need convened review (also commonly referred to as “full committee” or “full board” review) and must receive majority approval from members at the meeting

## History and Ethical Principles

Under the principle of beneficence:

1. Risks to subjects are minimized
2. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result
3. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects
4. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data

## Defining Research with Human Subjects

Defining research: a systematic investigation including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.

Defining human subjects: a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:

1. Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens
2. Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens

## The Federal Regulations - SBE

Protections for vulnerable subjects:

1. Subpart B - pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates
2. Subpart C - prisoners
3. Subpart D - children

If IRB decides to approve research, institutions can override by disapproving. This is not true in reverse.

## Assessing Risk - SBE

Three categories of risks in social and behavioral sciences:

1. Invasion of privacy
2. Breach of confidentiality
3. Study procedures

Safeguarding data tips:

- Use of as few direct identifiers as practical
- Remove all direct identifiers as soon as possible
- Substitute codes for identifiers
- Maintain code lists and data files in separate secure locations
- Use accepted methods to protect against indirect identification, such as aggregate reporting or pseudonyms
- Use and protect computer passwords
- Encrypt transmitted and stored data
- Access and store data on computers without internet connections
- Minimize procedures involving transferring direct identifiers between persons
- Obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality

## Informed Consent - SBE

- **Non-exculpatory language** - e.g., _your participation in this research is voluntary_
- **Exculpatory language** - e.g., _you waive any right to sue or for compensation for injuries that you may receive as a result of participating gin this study_

IRB may waive documentation under: the subject's participation in the research, and the consent document is the only record linking the subject with the research

## Privacy and Confidentiality - SBE

Procedures to protect confidential data:

- Creating keys linking subjects' names
- Unique numbers associated with the data
- Storing encrypted data on secure servers
- Removing identifiers when data collection is completed
- Reporting data in aggregate
- Creating misleading identifiers in articles or presentations

It is not possible for a researcher to promise confidentiality in a focus group setting.

## Research with Children - SBE

Children are defined as:

- Person who has not yet attained the legal age of majority in the setting the research will take place
- Age requirement varies by location

Parental permission waiver permissions:

- The documentation of consent (informed consent form) is the only record linking the child to the research, and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. If subjects wish to have a signed consent form, their wishes will govern
- The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm and involves no procedures for which consent is normally required outside the research environment
- If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects, and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained

An IRB may waive the requirement to secure child assent if either:

1. The capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted
2. The intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research

## Research in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools - SBE

Regulations

The following activities with school children do not qualify for exemption under Category 2 if subject to Subpart D:

- Research involving surveys
- Research involving interviews
- Observation of public behavior when the researcher participates in the activities being observed

Notes from modules in CITI training

## Belmont Report and Its Principles

Three basic ethical principles:

1. Respect for Persons
2. Beneficence
3. Justice

## Students in Research

- **Undue influence** - Whether positive (individuals wish to participate out of belief that it will gain favor with a superior) or negative (individuals fear repercussions from a superior for participating), institutional hierarchies can affect how potential subjects feel about volunteering for a study
- **Convened review** - When research activities pose significantly higher risks to subjects than those that might occur in daily life, the project will need convened review (also commonly referred to as “full committee” or “full board” review) and must receive majority approval from members at the meeting

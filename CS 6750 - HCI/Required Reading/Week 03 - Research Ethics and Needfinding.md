# Week 3

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

What is research? There are three different definitions:

1. An exercise as simple as careful or diligent search
2. Collecting information about a particular subject
3. Investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts and revision of accepted theories or laws in light of new facts

In HCI research we don’t prove things; we gather facts and formulate and test evidence.

Research, according to the third definition, involves discovery, interpretation, and revision.

Research must be reproducible.

Tim Brown CEO of IDEO design firm on prototypes:

> Prototypes should command only as much time, effort, and investment as are needed to generate useful feedback and evolve an idea. The more “finished” a prototype seems, the less likely its creators will be to pay attention to and profit from feedback. The goal of prototyping isn’t to finish. It is to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the idea and to identify new directions that further prototypes might take

Various definitions of empirical research:

1. Originating in or based on observation or experience
2. Relying on experience or observation alone, often without due regard for system and theory
3. Capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment

Three common research methods in HCI which are empirical:

1. Observational method
2. Experimental method
3. Correlational method

Tips for finding an interesting research topic:

1. Think small
2. Replicate
3. Know the literature
4. Think inside the box

Some terms from this section:

- **Theory** - a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation
- **Law** - a relationship or phenomenon that is invariable under given conditions
- **Patent** - is also a publication, describes previous related work (prior art), how the invention addresses a need, and the best mode of implementation
- **Internal validity** - is the extent to which an effect observed is due to the test conditions
- **External validity** - is the extent to which experimental results are generalizable to other people and other situations
- **Ecological validity** - refers to the methodology (using materials, tasks and situations typical of the real world), whereas external validity refers to the outcome (obtaining results that generalize to a broad range of people and situations)

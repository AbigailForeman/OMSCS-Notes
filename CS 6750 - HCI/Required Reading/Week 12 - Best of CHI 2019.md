# Week 12

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## A Framework For The Experience Of Meaning In Human-Computer Interaction

> Mekler, E. & Hornbæk, K. (2019). A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: presenting a framework to evaluate _meaning_ in HCI.

Meaning may be used as a non-modifying term to indicate a general sense of purpose, significance, or coherence.

Three aspects of meaning:

1. **Ontology** - concerns our relationship to the objects in the world, from which meaning can be constructed
2. **Inter-subjectivity** - is about the sharing of meaning, in a sense, that different people can come to shared understanding about the world and each other, despite not having access to each other’s mental states
3. **Intentionality** - concerns the relationship between action and meaning

> The key idea of the framework is that the experience of meaning consists of five distinct, albeit related components – connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and significance

Assumptions:

1. We focus on meaning as a moment-to-moment experience
2. The framework conceptualizes meaning as a chiefly subjective experience
3. Despite its vast and seemingly abstract nature, the experience of meaning is not ineffable

## Touchstone2: An Interactive Environment For Exploring Trade-Offs In HCI Experiment Design

> Eiselmayer, A., Wacharamanotham, C., Beaudouin-Lafon, M., & Mackay, W. (2019). Touchstone2: An Interactive Environment for Exploring Trade-offs in HCI Experiment Design. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: a direct-manipulation interface that is able to generate and examine trade-offs.

Interviewed participants highlighted the following problems in designs:

1. Time constraints
2. Weighing design alternatives
3. Counterbalancing problems
4. Representing experiment designs
5. Power analysis to select sample size

> Primary goal is to improve the quality and reproducibility of HCI experiments by offering researchers a tool for specifying and comparing alternative experiment designs.

## Online Grocery Delivery Services: An Opportunity To Address Food Disparities In Transportation-Scarce Areas

> Dillahunt, T., Simioni, S., & Xu, X. (2019). Online Grocery Delivery Services: An Opportunity to Address Food Disparities in Transportation-scarce Areas. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: online grocery delivery services to serve low-resource areas.

Main research questions:

1. Does the online grocery-delivery model serve as a feasible model to provide healthy-food access to low-income and transportation-scarce individuals?
2. Does an online grocery-delivery service lead to healthier-food choices?
3. What opportunities exist for online grocery delivery service design to support healthy choices among individuals living in low-income and transportation scarce environments?

Researchers used structural coding to quickly access relevant data from their data set.

> We found that the service not only provided participants with access to healthy food but that our Shipt group purchased a higher percentage of healthy grocery items overall

## A Framework For The Experience Of Meaning In Human-Computer Interaction

> Mekler, E. & Hornbæk, K. (2019). A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: presenting a framework to evaluate _meaning_ in HCI.

Meaning may be used as a non-modifying term to indicate a general sense of purpose, significance, or coherence.

Three aspects of meaning:

1. **Ontology** - concerns our relationship to the objects in the world, from which meaning can be constructed
2. **Inter-subjectivity** - is about the sharing of meaning, in a sense, that different people can come to shared understanding about the world and each other, despite not having access to each other’s mental states
3. **Intentionality** - concerns the relationship between action and meaning

> The key idea of the framework is that the experience of meaning consists of five distinct, albeit related components – connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and significance

Assumptions:

1. We focus on meaning as a moment-to-moment experience
2. The framework conceptualizes meaning as a chiefly subjective experience
3. Despite its vast and seemingly abstract nature, the experience of meaning is not ineffable

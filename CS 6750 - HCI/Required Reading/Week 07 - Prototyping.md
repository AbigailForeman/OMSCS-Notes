# Week 7

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## What Do Prototypes Prototype

> Houde, S., & Hill, C. (1997). What do prototypes prototype? In M. Helandar, T.K. Landaeur, & P. Prabhu (Eds). Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction, 2. (pp. 367-381). Elsevier Science.

Topic: to establish a model that describes any prototype in terms of the artifact being designed, rather than the prototype’s incidental attributes.

Paper aims to focus more attention on fundamental questions about the interactive system being designed: What role will the artifact play in a user’s life? How should it look and feel? How should it be implemented?

By focusing on the purpose of the prototype—that is, on what it prototypes—we can make better decisions about the kinds of prototypes to build.

### The Problem With Prototypes

It is difficult for designers to communicate clearly about prototypes to such a broad audience. It is challenging to build prototypes which produce feedback from users on the most important design questions.

### What Is A Prototype

What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.

### Definitions

- **Artifact** - the interactive system being designed
- **Prototype** - any representation of a design idea, regardless of medium
- **Designer** - anyone who creates a prototype in order to design, regardless of job title
- **Model**:
  - **Role** - refers to questions about the function that an artifact serves in a user’s life—the way in which is it useful to them
  - **Look and feel** - denotes questions about the concrete sensory experience of using an artifact—what the user looks at, feels, and hears while using it
  - **Implementation** - refers to questions about the techniques and components through which an artifact performs its function

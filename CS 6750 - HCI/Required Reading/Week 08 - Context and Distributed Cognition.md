## How A Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds

> Hutchins, E. (1995). How a cockpit remembers its speeds. Cognitive Science, 19(3). (pp. 265-288).

Topic: distributed cognitive system presented as an analysis of a memory task in the cockpit of a commercial airliner.

The task is to control the configuration of the airplane to match the changes
in speed required for maneuvering in the approach and landing.

The cockpit system remembers its speeds, and the memory process emerges
from the activity of the pilots. The memory of the cockpit, however, is not
made primarily of pilot memory.

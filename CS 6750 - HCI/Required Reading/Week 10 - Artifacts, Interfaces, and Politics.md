Topic: relationship between designing for usability and evaluating usability to build overarching theory of HCI.

Design methods have evolved over decades:

- First generation, or product oriented, design methods focused on systems theory and software engineering
- Second generation, or process oriented, design methods developed in the 1970â€™s, focused on user participation, communication and democracy in the design process
- Third generation, or use oriented design methods, focus on the actual use situation and assess the quality in use of the designed system

Evaluations can be done four basic ways: automatically, empirically, formally, and informally

In HCI research, design and evaluation are typically treated as separate activities. In addition, students are typically taught these skills separately and industry typically hires people to be either designers or evaluators.

> Overall, the HCI community sees seven clusters of authors with seven corresponding viewpoints within the topic of usability... Topics do not split between design and evaluation, but rather split according to philosophies of how systems should be designed and evaluated

# Week 6

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Section 3.4: Mental Models & Metaphor

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Section 3.4: Mental Models & Metaphor. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 88-92). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: mental models and metaphors.

One of the most common ways to learn and adapt is through _physical analogy_ or _metaphor_. Physical analogies and metaphors are examples of the more general concept of _mental models_, also known as _conceptual models_.

- **Implementation models** - are systems that impose on the user a set of interactions that follow the inner workings of an application; they are to be avoided

## Section 3.8: Interaction Errors

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Section 3.8: Interaction errors. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 111-116). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: the big errors are the easy onesâ€”they get fixed. It is the small errors that are interesting.

At the end of the day, however, human performance is what counts. Physical properties, although instructive and essential, are secondary.

Another reason little errors tend to linger is that they are often deemed _user errors_, not design, programming, or system errors. These errors, like most, are more correctly called _design-induced errors_.

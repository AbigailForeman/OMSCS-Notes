# Week 5

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies For Distributed HCI Design

> Faste, H., Rachmel, N., Essary, R., & Sheehan, E. (2013, April). Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: new ideation strategies for distributed HCI design. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 1343-1352). ACM.

Topic: brainstorming is more than the pooling of “invented” ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways. Ideation, in short, is the radical redistribution of ideas to “unconventionalize” a given context.

Effective brainstorming:

1. Criticism is ruled out - adverse judgment of ideas must be withheld until later
2. “Free-wheeling” is welcomed - the wilder the idea the better; it is easier to tame down than to think up
3. Quantity is wanted - the greater the number of ideas, the more the likelihood of useful ideas
4. Combination and improvement are sought - in addition to contributing ideas of their own, participants should suggest how ideas of others can be turned into better ideas; or how two or more ideas can be joined into still another idea

Limitations of brainstorming:

1. Production blocking
2. Evaluation apprehension
3. Free riding

Structuring ideation:

1. Face-to-face brainstorming
2. Nominal idea generation sessions
3. Computer mediated ideation

Model for group ideation:

1. Prompting
2. Sharing
3. Selecting
4. Committing

- **Cheatstorming** - no new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur

## Chapter 6: The Process Of Interaction Design

> Rogers, Y., Sharp, H., & Preece, J. (2011). Chapter 6: The Process of Interaction Design. In Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction. John Wiley & Sons.

Topic: how to design and build interactive products.

Main points:

1. Consider what _doing_ design involves
2. Ask and provide answers for important questions about the interaction design process
3. Introduce the idea of a life cycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related
4. Describe some life cycle models from software engineering and HCI and discuss how they relate to the process of interaction design
5. Present a life cycle model of interaction design

### What Is Interaction Design About

Interaction design is about allowing users' concerns to direct the development vs technical concerns.

### Four Basic Activities Of Interaction Design

Below are four basic activities of interaction design:

1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements
2. Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements
3. Building interactive versions so that they can be communicated and assessed
4. Evaluating them

### Key Characteristics Of The Interaction Design Process

1. Focus on users
2. Specific usability and user experience goals
3. Iteration

### How Do You Generate Alternative Designs

Looking at others' designs provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to consider alternative design solutions, which is key to effective design.

### Life Cycle Models: Showing How The Activities Are Related

The term _life cycle model_ is used to represent a model that captures a set of activities and how they are related.

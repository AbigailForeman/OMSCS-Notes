> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies For Distributed HCI Design

> Faste, H., Rachmel, N., Essary, R., & Sheehan, E. (2013, April). Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: new ideation strategies for distributed HCI design. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 1343-1352). ACM.

Topic: brainstorming is more than the pooling of “invented” ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways. Ideation, in short, is the radical redistribution of ideas to “unconventionalize” a given context.

Effective brainstorming:

1. Criticism is ruled out - adverse judgment of ideas must be withheld until later
2. “Free-wheeling” is welcomed - the wilder the idea the better; it is easier to tame down than to think up
3. Quantity is wanted - the greater the number of ideas, the more the likelihood of useful ideas
4. Combination and improvement are sought - in addition to contributing ideas of their own, participants should suggest how ideas of others can be turned into better ideas; or how two or more ideas can be joined into still another idea

Limitations of brainstorming:

1. Production blocking
2. Evaluation apprehension
3. Free riding

Structuring ideation:

1. Face-to-face brainstorming
2. Nominal idea generation sessions
3. Computer mediated ideation

Model for group ideation:

1. Prompting
2. Sharing
3. Selecting
4. Committing

- **Cheatstorming** - no new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur

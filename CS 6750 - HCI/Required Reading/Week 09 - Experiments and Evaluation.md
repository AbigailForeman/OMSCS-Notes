# Week 9

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Chapter 5: Designing HCI Experiments

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Chapter 5: Designing HCI Experiments. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 157-188). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: designing HCI experiments.

> One way to think about experiment design is through a signal and noise metaphor. In the metaphor, we divide our observations and measurements into two components: signal and noise.

- Signal is related to a variable of interest, such as input device, feedback mode, or an interaction technique under investigation
- Noise is everything elseâ€”the random influences

Thinking about experimental variables forces us to craft narrow and testable questions. The two most important experimental variables are independent variables and dependent variables.

There are tradeoffs between random and control variables:

| Variable | Advantage                                                                                   | Disadvantage                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Random   | Improves external validity by using a variety of situations and people.                     | Compromises internal validity by introducing additional variability in the measured behaviours. |
| Control  | Improves internal validity since variability due to a controlled circumstance is eliminated | Compromises external validity by limiting responses to specific situations and people.          |

- **Independent variable** - a circumstance or characteristic that is manipulated or systematically controlled to elicit a change in a human response while the user is interacting with a computer
- **Dependent variable** - a measured human behavior

- Within-subjects is also called _repeated measures_, because the measurements on each test condition are repeated for each participant
- For a between-subjects design, a separate group of participants is used for each test condition

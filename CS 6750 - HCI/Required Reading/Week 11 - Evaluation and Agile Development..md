# Week 11

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Cognitive Walkthroughs: A Method For Theory-Based Evaluation Of User Interfaces

> Polson, P. G., Lewis, C., Rieman, J., & Wharton, C. (1992). Cognitive walkthroughs: a method for theory-based evaluation of user interfaces. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 36(5). (pp. 741-773).

Topic: a new methodology (cognitive walkthroughs) for performing theory-based evaluations of the user interface designs early in the design cycle.

Main focus of cognitive walkthroughs: **ease of learning**.

Cognitive walkthrough inputs:

- Detailed design description of the user interface
- A task scenario
- Explicit assumptions about the user population and the context of use
- A sequence of actions with which a user could successfully complete the task using the design under evaluation

Goal structure management comes in four forms:

1. Generating the goal structure
2. Generating goals for actions
3. Interpreting feedback
4. "And-then" goal structure

What distinguishes cognitive walkthroughs from other evaluation methods?

1. Role of simulation
2. Focus on mental operations
3. Use of task context
4. Links to the interface
5. Role of theory

Assumptions:

- User’s initial goals for a task will be incomplete in that they do not specify a complete task decomposition that includes both representations of subtasks and the action sequence necessary to carry out each subtask
- Prompts, button labels and menu items interact with the user’s background knowledge and existing goals to create more explicit goals, which define components of the complete task and establish goals to perform specific actions
- The lowest-level goal is to execute some physical action
- When an action has been taken, the goal structure must be revised
- In many tasks and in interactive dialogs, goals are not posted individually but as part of a structure that represents a goal and an associated sequence of subgoals that must be accomplished in a fixed order

> The cognitive walkthrough is a precisely specified procedure for simulating a user’s cognitive processes as the user interacts with an interface in an effort to accomplish a specific task.

A cognitive walkthrough has two phases, preparation and evaluation.

# Lesson 17

This lesson will cover the following topics:

1. **Design alternatives** - when we start to brainstorm how to accomplish the task we've been investigating
2. Generating ideas
3. Exploring ideas

## The Second Biggest Mistake

The biggest mistake a designer can make is jumping straight to designing an interface without understanding the users or understanding the task. The second biggest mistake is settling on a single design idea or a single genre of design ideas too early.

The settling on a single idea can take on multiple forms:

1. Staying too allegiant to existing designs or products
2. Focusing too strongly on one alternative from the very beginning

## Design Space

- **Design space** - the area in which we design our interfaces

Our goal during the design alternative phase is to explore the possible design space. We do not want to narrow down the design space too early.

## Individual Brainstorming

During the design alternative phase we want to generate many ideas. Researchers claim that it is better to start with individual brainstorming before conducting a group brainstorming session.

## 5 Tips: Individual Brainstorming

1. Write down the core problem
2. Constrain yourself
3. Aim for 20
4. Take a break
5. Divide and conquer

## Challenges In Group Brainstorming

- **Social loafing** - the tendency to exert less effort working in groups than working alone
- **Conformity** - the tendency to agree with or follow the group's reasoning and ideas
- **Production blocking** - the tendency of some individuals in discussions to block other individual's participation
- **Performance matching** - the tendency to match one's level of performance to other collaborators
- **Power dynamics** - the tendency to defer to more senior individuals, or to overpower less senior individuals

## Rules For Group Brainstorming

1. Expressiveness
2. Non-evaluation
3. Quantity
4. Building

There are four additional rules:

1. Stay focused
2. No explaining ideas
3. Revisit the problem
4. encourage others

## 5 Tips: Group Brainstorming

1. Go through every individual idea
2. Find the optimal size
3. Set clear rules for communication
4. Set clear expectations
5. End with ideas, not decisions

## Fleshing Out Ideas

The next step in brainstorm is fleshing out ideas, below are some methods on how we do that:

1. **Personas** - create actual characters to represent our users
2. **User profiles** - defining a number of different variables about our users and possibilities within each
3. **Timelines** - taking our personas and thinking about their thoughts and actions over time and various stages of interacting with our interface (a general approach)
4. **Scenarios and storyboards** - examining the specific scenarios users will encounter while using our interfaces (a more specific approach)
5. **User modeling** - where personas are personal and will give us an empathetic view of the UX, user models are more objective and meant to give us measurable and comparable view of the UX

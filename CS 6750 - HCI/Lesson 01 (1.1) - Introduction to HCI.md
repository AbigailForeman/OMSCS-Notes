- **Human Factors Engineering** - designing interactions between people and products, systems, or devices
- **HCI** - largely about understanding interactions between humans and computers
- **UX Design** - dictating the interactions between users and computers
- HCI uses research to inform designs and the results of those designs informs the ongoing research, this behavior could be thought as a feedback loop

## Origin Of Institutional Review Board

Due to unethical experiments such as the _Milgram Experiment_, _Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment_, and _Stanford Prison Experiment_ the _National Research Act_ was enacted (1974). This led to the creation of institutional review boards to oversee research at universities.

In general, the benefits to society must outweigh the risks to the subjects in the case of these experiments.

- **Belmont Report** - summarizes basic ethical principles that research must follow in order to receive government support.

# Lesson 6

This week will we cover the following topics:

1. **Direct manipulation** - the user should interact directly with their task
2. **Invisible interfaces** - an interface that disappears between the user and their task

## Direct Manipulation Interfaces

Some lessons from the _Direct Manipulation Interfaces_ paper:

1. **Distance** - the distance between users goals and the system itself. The greater the cognitive load required to use the system, the less direct to the interaction with the system actually feels. Distance can be broken into:
   1. **Semantic distance** - distance between users goals and their expression in the system, i.e., how hard it is to know what to do
   2. **Articulatory distance** - distance between that expression and its execution, i.e., how hard it is to actually do what you know to do
2. **Direct engagement** - systems that best exemplify direct manipulation all give the qualitative feeling that one is engaged with the control of the objects - not with the programs, not with the computer, but with the semantic object of our goals and intentions

## 5 Tips: Invisible Interfaces

How do we accomplish invisible interfaces? Below are five tips:

1. Use affordances
2. Know your user
3. Differentiate your user
4. Let your interface teach
5. Talk to your user

# Lesson 4

In this lesson we will cover:

1. Focusing on the task
2. Role of the interface in mediating users and tasks
3. The role of the user: Processor? Predictor? Participant?
4. User experience at multiple levels

## Identifying A Task

How do should we go about identifying a task?

1. Watch real users
2. Talk to them
3. Start small
4. Abstract up
5. You are not your user

## Usefulness and Usability

Remember that one of the goals of HCI is to not only make a product that is useful but also useable.

- **Cognitive load** - the total mental effort being used in working memory

## Views Of The User

There are three different roles a human can play:

1. **Processor**:

   - Stems from Behaviorism (observable behaviors and outcomes)
   - Interface must fit within human limits
   - Evaluated by quantitative experiments

2. **Predictor**:

   - Stems from Cognitivism (what goes on in the users mind?)
   - Interface must fit with knowledge
   - Evaluated by qualitative studies

3. **Participant**:

   - Stems from Functionalism (user and the interface are participants in an environment)
   - Interface must fit with the context
   - Evaluated by _in situ_ studies

- **Ex situ** - in a controlled or otherwise inauthentic environment
- **In situ** - within the authentic context

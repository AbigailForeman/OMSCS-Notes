# Lesson 2

> Design is better learned than taught

## TextBrowser Exercise

There are several of elements for the TextBrowser:

1. **FileManager**:

   - Some way to access the file's contents
   - Provide a module that can retrieve a limited length, consecutive subsequence of the file's lines

2. **ViewPort**: need to be able to display the textual content graphically
3. **ScrollBar**: need to give the user some way to access different parts of the file

## Analysis Model

The analysis model will consist of various parts:

- UML class-model diagram
- Rectangles for classes
- Each rectangle is divided vertically
- Lines between the components denote relationships

## Operations

Operations comprise those actions that the user can undertake to interact with the TextBrowser

## Relationships

In a UML analysis model, you should be concerned with three types of relationships:

1. Associations
2. Aggregations
3. Generalizations

## Summary

What is the key design question with which any implementation of the TextBrowser must deal?

# Lesson 11

In this lesson we will revisit the UML diagram exercise we covered previously in the library exercise. We will focus on how we can leverage OCL to address additional aspects of the diagram.

## Limitations

For UML diagrams, either the specification as given by the diagram must be supplemented or an entirely new specification must be introduced.

## Side Effects

**Side effects** specify an even more complex situation - one where an operation actually results in a change of state.

## Observations

We should be open during the process of analysis to the possibility of new requirements arising. This could include further consultation with the customer. A simple set of requirements can have so many issues - this should illustrate the value of constructing an OCL specification.

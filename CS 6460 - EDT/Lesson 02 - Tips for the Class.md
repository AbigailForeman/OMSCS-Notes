# Lesson 2

There are two main tracks for this course:

- **Design Projects**:
  - Understand the problem, including the different stakeholders
  - Understand the current systems that try to solve parts of that problem, especially their strengths and weaknesses
  - Understand the broader pedagogical, cultural, or organizational issues at play in this problem
  - The goal will be to deliver a tool that address the problem
- **Research Projects**:
  - Understand and very clearly define the phenomenon you want to investigate. Sometimes defining the phenomenon may even be part of the research
  - Understand the current theories and methodologies that have been applied to this phenomenon
  - Understand the research methodologies that would give the data necessary to make useful statements about the phenomenon
  - The goal will be to deliver the research results including data and analysis

In addition, there will be an opportunity to pursue a hybrid project where the results of some research could be used to reflect on the design of a tool or a tool could be used to test research hypothesis
